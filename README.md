### Overview

For this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. This app works by calling the GIPHY API and using JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

### Application

1. I chose a tv show theme for my application. I created an array of strings, each of a different tv show. 

2. The app takes the topics in this array, loops through each string, and creates buttons in the HTML.

3. On the click of a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. 

4. When a still GIPHY image is clicked, the gif animates. When an animated gif is clicked, it should return to still.

5. The rating of the GIF is displayed with the image.

6. Other users can type in their favorite tv show, which gets added to the array of strings, and dynamically create a button to generate 10 gifs of that tv show.

7. Cool, huh?
